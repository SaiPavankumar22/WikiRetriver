Sure! Here's a well-structured, professional **README** for your project **Material-Generator**, covering all the relevant components, technologies, and usage details:

# 📚 Material-Generator

**Material-Generator** is a Generative AI-powered knowledge assistant that retrieves high-quality content from Wikipedia, semantically chunks the data, stores it in a FAISS vector database, and provides rewritten, easy-to-understand responses based on user queries using LLaMA-3 via Groq. This tool is ideal for educational use cases, personalized study material generation, and intelligent content summarization.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔍 **Wikipedia Search Integration**: Retrieves accurate and relevant content from Wikipedia using `WikipediaRetriever`.
* 🧠 **Semantic Chunking**: Groups related sentences using sentence similarity and cosine similarity thresholds.
* ⚡ **FAISS Vector Store**: Stores and indexes semantically meaningful text chunks for efficient retrieval.
* 🧾 **Reranked Responses**: Returns the top 5 semantically closest responses to a user query.
* ✍️ **LLM-based Rewriting**: Uses LLaMA-3 (via Groq) to rewrite chunks into simpler, user-friendly language.
* 🌐 **Wikipedia URL Retrieval**: Provides direct Wikipedia URLs related to the user query for further exploration.

## 🧪 Semantic Chunking Logic

Text is semantically chunked based on **cosine similarity** between sentence embeddings. Sentences with a similarity above a set threshold (default: `0.75`) are grouped into a single chunk to preserve contextual relevance.

---

## 📦 Installation

Run the following to install all required dependencies:

```bash
!pip install langchain-community
!pip install langchain-experimental
!pip install langchain-groq
!pip install faiss-cpu
!pip install wikipedia
!pip install sentence-transformers
!pip install beautifulsoup4
```

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables before running the script:

```python
os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_LANGSMITH_KEY"
os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
os.environ["GROQ_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
```

---

## 📋 How It Works

1. User enters a query (e.g., "Quantum Computing").
2. WikipediaRetriever fetches related documents.
3. HTML is cleaned using BeautifulSoup.
4. Documents are semantically chunked using `SentenceTransformer`.
5. Chunks are stored in a FAISS index.
6. FAISS is queried with the user input and reranked.
7. Top 5 chunks are passed through LLaMA-3 for rewriting.
8. Final outputs are displayed along with related Wikipedia links.

---

## 🖥️ Example Output

```text
Enter your query: Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is a form of computation that uses quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows for more complex and faster processing compared to traditional computers.
